## [3.0.2] - 2019-04-19
### Fixed
- "is Alphanumeric" should now work with all most commonly used charsets

## [3.0.1] - 2019-04-17
### Added
- The language guesser is now trained with the trigrams from the utterances used to train. That means that it has a best guess, and also that fictional languages can be guessed (example, klingon).
- Added Tagalog and Galician languages.

### Changed
-NlpClassifier no longer exists, in favor of NluManager as the manager of several NLU classes, and is able to manage several languages and several domains inside each language.
- Now by default, each domain of a language has it's own neural network classifier. When a language has more than 1 domain, a master neural network is trained that instead of classifying into the intent, classify into de domain. That way the models are faster to train and have a better score.
- The console-bot example training time in version 2.x in my laptop was 108 seconds, in the version 3.x the training time went down to 3 seconds, so the improvement in performance is notable.
- Size of the model.nlp files is decreased, the console-bot example went from 1614KB down to 928KB.
- The browser version has decreased from 5.08MB down to 2.3MB
